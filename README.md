Regression, Classification and Clustering

. Standardized the dataset and split the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) dataset using holdout method with sklearn library.
• Built several regression models on the training dataset from various combinations of attributes using statsmodels library and selected best regression models for Democratic and Republican votes with an adjusted R2 value of 0.870 and 0.855.
• Created four classification models using sklearn library to classify counties as Democratic and Republican based on multiple combinations of attributes and got best F1 Scores of 0.67 and 0.88 using K-Nearest Neighbours (k=4) classifier.
• Developed four clustering models using sklearn and scipy libraries to group the observations into two clusters and got best silhouette coefficient of 0.903 using K-Means technique (with random initial centroids and no of instances = 10).
